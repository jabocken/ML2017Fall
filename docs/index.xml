      <description>Objective The objective of the project is to build an image classifier for the cdiscount.com&amp;rsquo;s dataset.
Introduction For this project, we took up a Kaggle competition to build a product classifier for cdiscount.com, an online non-food shopping website based in France. cdiscount.com has provided a dataset containing images for over 7M products and their categories. The challenge is to build a machine learning-based solution that learns from the dataset and makes predictions on test images.</description>

      <description>InceptionV3 The “Inception” micro-architecture was first introduced by Szegedy et al. in their 2014 paper, Going Deeper with Convolutions:
 The original Inception module used in GoogLeNet.   The original incarnation of this architecture was called GoogLeNet, but subsequent manifestations have simply been called Inception vN where N refers to the version number put out by Google.
The Inception V3 architecture included in the Keras core comes from the later publication by Szegedy et al.</description>

      <description>This page describes the dataset provided by cdiscount.com and the steps we took to strip down the dataset to better accomodate our limited hardware resources.
Raw Data and Categories: Data The datasets were provided in BSON (Binary JSON) format. The training data consisted of a list of 7,069,896 dictionaries each representing a product. Each product consisted of a product identifier product_id, category identifier category_id and a list of about 1-4 images.</description>
