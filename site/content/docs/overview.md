## Objective

The objective of the project is to build an image classifier for the cdiscount.com's dataset. 

## Introduction

For this project, we took up a Kaggle competition to build a product classifier for cdiscount.com, an online non-food shopping website based in France. cdiscount.com has provided a dataset containing images for over 7M products and their categories. The challenge is to build a machine learning-based solution that learns from the dataset and makes predictions on test images. 

## Problem Reduction

Each product image belongs to a tuple of three categories, representing an categorial hierarchy. However, we had significant limitations in hardware resources.
